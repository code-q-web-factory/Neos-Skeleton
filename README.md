# Code Q Neos-Skeleton

The Neos-Skeleton provides an easy and powerful start for new projects - beginner-friendly and highly scalable. It implements all current [best practices](https://www.neos.io/blog/neos-best-practices-1-0.html) for Neos 7 and is frontend agnostic.

It combines contributions of some of the best Neos developers with experience from Code Q. It is inspired by [Flowpack Neos best practice examples (Dmitri Pisarev and Dominique Feyer)](https://github.com/Flowpack/fusion-bp), the [path repository setup (Christian Müller)](https://www.neos.io/blog/project-repository-best-practice.html) and [AFX (Martin Ficzel)](https://github.com/PackageFactory/atomic-fusion-afx).

On top, it adds well-tested community packages to provide everything you need for an amazing website.
